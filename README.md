Description

In this task, you are required to design a single page weather forecast application using any public API of your choice (for example, OpenWeatherMap API).
The user should be able to:

1. Enter a city name and view the current weather details of the city, which includes:
   - Current temperature
   - Minimum and maximum temperature
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed and direction
   - Description of the weather (e.g., clear sky, light rain, etc.)
   - An appropriate icon reflecting the current weather

2. View a 5-day forecast for the selected city, displaying:
   - Date
   - Average temperature
   - Description of the weather
   - An appropriate weather icon
  
3. Technical Requirements
- The application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The application is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile.
- The application is user-friendly and intuitive, with clear error handling. For example, if a user enters a city name that doesn't exist, there should be an appropriate error message.
